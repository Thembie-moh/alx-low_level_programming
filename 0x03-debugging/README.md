0x03-debugging

Using the Rubber Duck Method, here I am going to debug several functions based on stipulated instructions

Task 0
This will  test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0

Task 1
This function will comment out a part of the code that causes the code to go into a loop

Task 2
This function is supposed to make sure it prints out the largest of three numbers no matter the case 

Task 3
The function has to count the number of days left in a year and consider leap year in the counting.
